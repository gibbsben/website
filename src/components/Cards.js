During these times, the differences between inhabitants and volunteers are barely visible, even though one could recognize the residents by their winning, strategical skills. "

During this time, I have been humbled to get to know and learn from a lot of my friends on the street. All of these experiences have shaped my view of how all people – houseless or not – should be treated, and guide me in my actions as a student, friend, and future doctor. I look forward to being able to make a positive impact in my community here in Maastricht with the Homeless Project Maastricht."
